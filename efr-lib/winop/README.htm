<h4 align=CENTER>Abstract</h4>
<P align=JUSTIFY>
The  winop is  a library  that attempts  to provide  a unification
layer for managing and manipulating windows.  The library provides
equivalent for  a number of  the 'wm' and 'winfo'  commands, while
being  able to control  both regular  Tk applications  and foreign
Windows applications.
</P>
<P align=LEFT>
The winop library provides a unification layer that allows programmers
to operate on windows whichever application they are originating from.
The library provides a number of commands equivalent for the regular Tk
'wm' and 'winfo' commands, but is able to handle both your application'
own Tk windows and foreign Windows applications.
</P>
<P align=LEFT>
The emulation layer is not yet complete, so this library is likely to
grow with time.  winop is subject to the new BSD license, I would
appreciate to incorporate any modifications and improvements that you
make to the library.
</P>
<P align=LEFT>
For the time being, winop has very little documentation and you will
have to read the code.

The library is hosted at the following address: <A
