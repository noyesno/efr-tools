# cmdserver.tcl --
#
#	This module implements a generic command server implementation
#	for implementing simple command line protocols.  The module
#	provides for basic security control through host allowance and
#	denial.  Apart for a few initialisations, calling modules will
#	simply have to provide one or several callbacks for the
#	implementation of command logic.
