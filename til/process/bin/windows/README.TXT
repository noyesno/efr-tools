You can place any of the following distribution of windows process
explorers in their respective directories.

* pslist from http://www.sysinternals.com (you will need pslist.exe
  and pskill.exe).  The pslist utilities seem to be blocking the
  caller (and never ending) on some machines.

* pv, the command-line process viewer from PrcView available from
  http://www.teamcti.com/pview/prcview.htm.  pv is currently not able
  to return the memory size of processes.
